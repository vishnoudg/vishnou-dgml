"""Pass B — semantic labeling with a shared concept roster.

Documents are labeled in bounded chunks (per document, split further when
very large), with the **concept roster accumulated so far** fed into every
subsequent call: "these concepts exist — reuse them verbatim where the role
matches". Cross-document consistency comes from the roster, while each call
stays small enough that the model can label *densely* instead of
cherry-picking a handful of values.

Density contract: every heading block MUST receive a section-role concept;
repeating items/rows/fields receive their shared role; only connective prose may stay
unlabeled. Option I still applies — boilerplate paragraphs with no
queryable role legitimately get nothing — but "skip almost everything" is
not a permitted reading anymore.

Text is never touched; entities are VERBATIM QUOTES of the value, located
in the block's text by the pipeline — the model never counts positions.

    *on_label_error* — called ``(doc_name, {code, message})`` — is invoked once
    per document whose label model *could not be reached at all* (auth, bad
    model id, connection), so the caller can surface a misconfigured
    ``label_model`` in machine-readable output without discarding the
    transcription. A soft outcome (call succeeded but produced few/no labels)
    does NOT fire it. Planning (``plan_concept_roster``) needs no separate hook:
    if the model is unreachable at planning time the same config makes every
    per-document chunk raise too, so per-document detection covers it. Warnings
    are still returned unchanged.

    *schema_seed* (from a user-supplied ``--schema-path`` or the docset's own
    ``schema.json`` on an incremental run) is used as the starting roster with
    FULL fidelity — role descriptions, curated examples, kind, hierarchy —
    INSTEAD of the planning call (Pass B.1). This makes the vocabulary
    deterministic and authoritative; per-document labeling still extends it for
    roles the seed does not cover. *roster_seed* is the legacy flat
    ``{concept: description}`` seed (``cache/concept_roster.json``) — same
    semantics, no examples/kind/hierarchy; ignored when *schema_seed* is given.

    Unseeded runs are STAGED: after planning, the largest documents label
    first (a pilot), their observations promote the planned roster to
    confirmed — real examples, observed kinds, tree-derived parents — and the
    rest of the batch labels against that confirmed vocabulary.

    With *cache_dir* set, each call's RAW return is written as
    ``label_<stem>_cNN_raw.json`` and the final concept roster as
    ``concept_roster.json`` — functional files the next run reloads. With
    *debug* additionally set, the per-call input listings
    (``label_<stem>_cNN_input.txt``) and section-retry artifacts are written
    too (debug-only; never read back).
